## Project Overview

OpenBreath is a Flutter application designed to help users practice various breathing exercises for relaxation and meditation. The app features:

- Multiple breathing exercise patterns
- Progressive exercise programs
- Multi-language support
- Customizable durations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- An IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` to generate localization files
4. Use `flutter run` to start the application

## Localization

The app uses Flutter's gen-l10n for localization. Currently supported languages:
- English (`en`)
- Dutch (`nl`)

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/`, e.g. `app_es.arb` for Spanish
2. Copy all keys from `app_en.arb` and translate the values
3. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```
4. Rebuild the app. The new locale will be included automatically in `supportedLocales`
5. To expose the language in Settings:
   - Add an entry to the language dropdown in `lib/settings_screen.dart`
   - Add the language to the enum in `lib/settings_provider.dart`

### Changing Language at Runtime

Users can change the app language through the Settings screen (`Settings > Language`):
- System default
- English
- Dutch

The selected language is persisted with `shared_preferences` and applied on startup.

## Exercise Data

Exercise data is stored in a single JSON file: `assets/exercises.json`. This file contains all exercises with translations for all supported languages.

### Exercise Structure

```json
[
  {
    "id": "box-breathing",
    "pattern": "4-4-4-4",
    "duration": "4 min",
    "title": {
      "en": "Box Breathing",
      "nl": "Box Ademhaling"
    },
    "intro": {
      "en": "A simple technique to calm your mind and body.",
      "nl": "Een eenvoudige techniek om je geest en lichaam te kalmeren."
    }
  }
]
```

### Adding or Updating Exercise Translations

1. Open `assets/exercises.json`
2. For each exercise, add a new key-value pair to the `title` and `intro` objects:
   - Key: Language code (e.g., "es" for Spanish)
   - Value: Translated text
3. If adding a new language to the app:
   - Add the language to the settings UI in `lib/settings_screen.dart`
   - Add the language to the enum in `lib/settings_provider.dart`
4. Rebuild the app
