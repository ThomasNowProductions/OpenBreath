## Exercise Model

The basic exercise model represents a single breathing exercise.

### Structure

```dart
class Exercise {
  final String id;

  final int duration;
  final Map<String, String> title;
  final Map<String, String> intro;
}
```

### Properties

- `id`: Unique identifier for the exercise
- `pattern`: Breathing pattern in the format "inhale-hold-exhale-hold"
- `duration`: Duration of the exercise in seconds
- `title`: Map of language codes to translated titles
- `intro`: Map of language codes to translated introductions

```

## ProgressiveExercise Model

The progressive exercise model represents a multi-stage breathing exercise that increases in difficulty.

### Structure

```dart

}

class ExerciseStage {

  final int duration;
}
```

### Properties

- `id`: Unique identifier for the exercise
